      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <p>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website (for example: games, responses when buttons are pressed or data entered in forms, dynamic styling, animation).</p>

      <h2>What is JavaScript really?</h2>
      <p>JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that, when applied to an HTML document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. It was invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.</p>
      <p>JavaScript itself is fairly compact yet very flexible. Developers have written a large variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of extra functionality with minimum effort. These include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</strong> — APIs built into web browsers, providing functionality like dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles, collecting and manipulating a video stream from the user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
        <li>Third-party APIs to allow developers to incorporate functionality in their sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</li>
        <li>Third-party frameworks and libraries you can apply to your HTML to allow you to rapidly build up sites and applications.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>A "hello world" example</h2>
      <p>The above section might sound really exciting, and so it should — JavaScript is one of the most lively web technologies, and as you start to get good at using it, your websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.</p>
      <p>However, becoming comfortable with JavaScript is a little harder than becoming comfortable with HTML and CSS. You may have to start small and keep working in small consistent steps. To start, we'll show how to add some basic JavaScript to your page, creating a "hello world!" example.</p>
      <hr>

      <h2>Language basics crash course</h2>
      <p>Let's explain some of the core features of the JavaScript language, to give you a better understanding of how it all works. It is worth noting that these features are common to all programming languages, so if you master these fundamentals, you're well on your way to being able to program just about anything!</p>
      <hr>

      <h3>Variables</h3>
      <p>Variables are containers that you can store values in. You start by declaring a variable with the var keyword, followed by any name you want to call it:</p>
      <code>var myVariable;</code>
      <p>Note: A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends; it is only absolutely required when you need to separate statements on a single line. However, some people believe that it is a good practice to put them in at the end of each statement.</p>
      <p>Note: You can name a variable nearly anything, but there are some name restrictions</p>
      <p>Note: JavaScript is case sensitive — <em>myVariable</em> is a different variable to <em>myvariable</em>. If you are getting problems in your code, check the casing!</p>
      <p>After declaring a variable, you can give it a value:
      <code>myVariable = 'Bob';</code></p>
      <p>You can do both these operations on the same line if you wish:
      <code>var myVariable = 'Bob';</code></p>
      <p>You can retrieve the value by just calling the variable by name:
      <code>myVariable;</code></p>
      <p>After giving a variable a value, you can later choose to change it:
      <code>myVariable = 'Steve';</code></p>

      <p>Note that variables may hold values that have different data types:</p>
      <table class="table table-bordered">
        <thead class="table-active">
          <th scope="col">Variable</th>
          <th scope="col">Explanation</th>
          <th scope="col">Example</th>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row">String</th>
            <td>A sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, you must enclose it in quote marks.</td>
            <td><code>var myVariable = 'Bob';</code></td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <th scope="row">Number</th>
            <td>A number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.</td>
            <td><code>var myVariable = 10;</code></td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <th scope="row">Boolean</th>
            <td>A True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords in JS, and don't need quotes.</td>
            <td><code>var myVariable = true;</code></td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <th scope="row">Array</th>
            <td>A structure that allows you to store multiple values in one single reference.</td>
            <td><code>var myVariable = [1,'Bob','Steve',10];</code><p>Refer to each member of the array like this:</p><code>myVariable[0], myVariable[1], </code> etc.</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <th scope="row">Object</th>
            <td>Basically, anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object, and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind as you learn.</td>
            <td><code>var myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');
            </code>All of the above examples too.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>So why do we need variables? Well, variables are needed to do anything interesting in programming. If values couldn't change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalize a greeting message or change the image displayed in an image gallery.</p>
      <hr>

      <h2>Comments</h2>
      You can put comments into JavaScript code, just as you can in CSS:
      <p><code>/*</p>
      <p>Everything in between is a comment.</p>
      <p>*/</code></p>
      If your comment contains no line breaks, it's often easier to put it behind two slashes like this: <code>// This is a comment</code>
      <hr>

      <h2>Operators</h2>
      <p>An operator is a mathematical symbol which produces a result based on two values (or variables). In the following table you can see some of the simplest operators, along with some examples to try out in the JavaScript console.</p>

      <table class="table table-bordered table-dark">
        <thead>
          <th scope="col">Operator</th>
          <th scope="col">Explanation</th>
          <th scope="col">Symbol(s)</th>
          <th scope="col">Example</th>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row">Addition</th>
            <td>Used to add two numbers together or glue two strings together.</td>
            <td><code>+</code></td>
            <td><code><p>6 + 9;</p>
                "Hello " + "world!";</code></td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <th scope="row"><p>Subtraction,</p> <p>Multiplication,</p> Division</th>
            <td>These do what you'd expect them to do in basic math.</td>
            <td><code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code></td>
            <td><code><p>9 - 3;</p>
                      <p>8 * 2; // multiply in JS is an asterisk</p>
                      9 / 3;</code></td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <th scope="row">Equality</th>
            <td>Does a test to see if two values are equal to one another and returns a <em>true</em> / <em>false</em> (Boolean) result.</td>
            <td><code>===</code></td>
            <td><code><p>var myVariable = 3;</p>
                      myVariable === 4;</code></td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <th scope="row">Not, Does-not-equal</th>
            <td>Returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes; it turns a true into a false, etc. When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two values are not equal.</td>
            <td><code>!</code>,<code> !==</code></td>
            <td><code><p>var myVariable = 3;</p>
                      <p>!(myVariable === 3);</p></code>
                      <p>Here we are testing "<em>is myVariable NOT equal to 3</em>". This returns false because <em>myVariable</em> IS equal to 3.</p></td>
          </tr>

        </tbody>
      </table>
      There are a lot more operators to explore, but this is enough for now.
      <hr>
      <h2>Conditionals</h2>
      <p>Conditionals are code structures which allow you to test if an expression returns true or not, running alternative code revealed by its result. A very common form of conditionals is the <em>if ... else</em> statement. For example:</p>
      <code>
        <p>var iceCream = 'chocolate';</p>
        <p>if (iceCream === 'chocolate') {</p>
          <p>alert('Yay, I love chocolate ice cream!'); </p>   
        <p>} else {</p>
          <p>alert('Awwww, but chocolate is my favorite...');</p>  
        }
      </code>
      <p>The expression inside the if ( ... ) is the test — this uses the identity operator (as described above) to compare the variable iceCream with the string chocolate to see if the two are equal. If this comparison returns true, the first block of code is run. If the comparison is not true, the first block is skipped and the second code block, after the else statement, is run instead.</p>
      <hr>

      <h2>Functions</h2>
      <p>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. When you need the procedure you can call a function, with the function name, instead of rewriting the entire code each time. You have already seen some uses of functions above, for example:</p>
      <code><p>var myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');
          </p>alert('hello!');</code>

      <p>write a simple function which takes two numbers as arguments and multiplies them:</p>
      <code>
        <p>function multiply(num1,num2) {</p>
          <p>var result = num1 * num2;</p>
          <p>return result;</p>
        <p>}</p>
      </code>
      <hr>

      <h2>Events</h2>
      <p>Real interactivity on a website needs events. These are code structures which listen for things happening in browser, running code in response. The most obvious example is the click event, which is fired by the browser when you click on something with your mouse. To demonstrate this, enter the following into your console, then click on the current webpage:</p>
      <code>
          <p>document.querySelector('html').onclick = function() {</p>
          <p>alert('Ouch! Stop poking me!');</p>
      }
      </code>
      <p>There are many ways to attach an event to an element. Here we select the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element, setting its onclick handler property equal to an anonymous (i.e. nameless) function, which contains the code we want the click event to run.</p>

      <code>document.querySelector('html').onclick = function() {};</code>
      <p>is equivalent to</p>
      <code>var myHTML = document.querySelector('html');</code>
      <code>myHTML.onclick = function() {};</code>
      <hr>

      <h2>Adding an image changer</h2>
      <p>In this section, we'll add an additional image to our site using some more DOM API features, using some JavaScript to switch between the two when the image is clicked.</p>
        <div class="container">
          <ol>
            <li>First of all, find another image you'd like to feature on your site. Be sure it is the same size as the first image, or as close as possible.</li>
            <li>Save this image in your <em>images</em> folder.</li>
            <li>Rename this image 'firefox2.png' (without quotes).</li>
            <li>Go to your main.js file, and enter the following JavaScript. (If your "hello world" JavaScript is still there, delete it.)
            <div>  
            <code>
            <p>var myImage = document.querySelector('img');</p>

            <p>myImage.onclick = function() {</p>
                <p>var mySrc = myImage.getAttribute('src');</p>
                <p>if(mySrc === 'images/firefox-icon.png') {</p>
                  <p>myImage.setAttribute ('src','images/firefox2.png');</p>
                <p>} else {</p>
                  <p>myImage.setAttribute ('src','images/firefox-icon.png');</p>
                <p>}</p>
            <p>}</p>
            </code>
            </div>
            </li>
            <li>Save all files and load index.html in the browser. Now when you click the image, it should change to the other one!</li>
          </ol>

          <p>You store a reference to your <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element in the <em>myImage</em> variable. Next, you make this variable's <em>onclick</em> event handler property equal to a function with no name (an "anonymous" function). Now, every time this element is clicked:</p>
          <div class="container">
            <ol>
              <li>You retrieve the value of the image's <em>src</em> attribute.</li>
              <li>You use a conditional to check whether the <em>src</em> value is equal to the path to the original image:</li>
                <ol>
                  <li>If it is, you change the <em>src</em> value to the path to the 2nd image, forcing the other image to be loaded inside the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element.</li>
                  <li>If it isn't (meaning it must already have changed), the <em>src</em> value swaps back to the original image path, to the original state.</li>
                </ol>
            </ol>
          </div>
        </div>
        <hr>

        <h2>Adding a personalized welcome message</h2>
        <p>Next we will add another bit of code, changing the page's title to a personalized welcome message when the user first navigates to the site. This welcome message will persist, should the user leave the site and later return — we will save it using the Web Storage API. We will also include an option to change the user and, therefore, the welcome message anytime it is required.</p>
          <div class="container">
            <ol>
              <li>In index.html, add the following line just before the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element:
                <p><code>&lt;button&gt;Change user&lt;/button&gt;</code></p>
              </li>
              <li>In <em>main.js</em>, place the following code at the bottom of the file, exactly as written — this takes references to the new button and the heading, storing them inside variables:
                <p><code>var myButton = document.querySelector('button');</code></p>
                <p><code>var myHeading = document.querySelector('h1');</code></p>
              </li>
              <li>Now add the following function to set the personalized greeting — this won't do anything yet, but we'll fix this in a moment:
                <p><code>function setUserName() {</p>
                  <p>var myName = prompt('Please enter your name.');</p>
                  <p>localStorage.setItem('name', myName);</p>
                  <p>myHeading.textContent = 'Mozilla is cool, ' + myName;</p>
                <p>}</p></code>
                <p>This function contains a prompt() function, which brings up a dialog box, a bit like alert(). This prompt(), however, asks the user to enter some data, storing it in a variable after the user presses OK. In this case, we are asking the user to enter their name. Next, we call on an API called localStorage, which allows us to store data in the browser and later retrieve it. We use localStorage's setItem() function to create and store a data item called 'name', setting its value to the myName variable which contains the data the user entered. Finally, we set the textContent of the heading to a string, plus the user's newly stored name.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Next, add this <em>if ... else</em> block — we could call this the initialization code, as it structures the app when it first loads:
                <p><code>if(!localStorage.getItem('name')) {</p>
                  <p>setUserName();</p>
                  <p>} else {</p>
                    <p>var storedName = localStorage.getItem('name');</p>
                    <p>myHeading.textContent = 'Mozilla is cool, ' + storedName;</p>
                  <p>}</p></code>
                  <p>This block first uses the negation operator (logical NOT, represented by the !) to check whether the name data exists. If not, the setUserName() function is run to create it. If it exists (that is, the user set it during a previous visit), we retrieve the stored name using getItem() and set the textContent of the heading to a string, plus the user's name, as we did inside setUserName().</p>
              </li>
              <li>Finally, put the below onclick event handler on the button. When clicked, the setUserName() function is run. This allows the user to set a new name, when they wish, by pressing the button:
                <p><code>myButton.onclick = function() {</p>
                          <p>setUserName();</p>
                        <p>}</p></code>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <p>Now when you first visit the site, it will ask you for your username, then give you a personalized message. You can change the name any time you like by pressing the button. As an added bonus, because the name is stored inside localStorage, it persists after the site is closed down, keeping the personalized message there when you next open the site!</p>
