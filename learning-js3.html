    <p>Now you've learned something about the theory of JavaScript, and what you can do with it, we are going to give you a crash course in the basic features of JavaScript via a completely practical tutorial. Here you'll build up a simple "Guess the number" game, step by step.</p>

    <p>You won't be expected to understand all of the code in detail immediately — we just want to introduce you to the high level concepts for now, and give you an idea of how JavaScript (and other programming languages) work. In subsequent articles you'll revisit all these features in a lot more detail!</p>

    <h2>Thinking like a programmer</h2>
    <p>One of the hardest things to learn in programming is not the syntax you need to learn, but how to apply it to solve real world problems. You need to start thinking like a programmer — this generally involves looking at descriptions of what your program needs to do,  working out what code features are needed to achieve those things, and how to make them work together.</p>

    <p>This requires a mixture of hard work, experience with the programming syntax, and practice — plus a bit of creativity. The more you code, the better you'll get at it. We can't promise that you'll develop "programmer brain" in five minutes, but we will give you plenty of opportunity to practice thinking like a programmer throughout the course.</p>

    <p>With that in mind, let's look at the example we'll be building up in this article, and review the general process of dissecting it into tangible tasks.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Example — Guess the number game</h2>
    <p>Let's imagine your boss has given you the following brief for creating this game:</p>
    <p>I want you to create a simple guess the number type game. It should choose a random number between 1 and 100, then challenge the player to guess the number in 10 turns. After each turn the player should be told if they are right or wrong — and, if they are wrong, whether the guess was too low or too high. It should also tell the player what numbers they previously guessed. The game will end once the player guesses correctly, or once they run out of turns. When the game ends, the player should be given an option to start playing again.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Upon looking at this brief, the first thing we can do is to start breaking it down into simple actionable tasks, in as much of a programmer mindset as possible:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Generate a random number between 1 and 100.</li>
      <li>Record the turn number the player is on. Start it on 1.</li>
      <li>Provide the player with a way to guess what the number is.</li>
      <li>Once a guess has been submitted first record it somewhere so the user can see their previous guesses.</li>
      <li>Next, check whether it is the correct number.</li>
      <li>If it is correct:
          <ol>
            <li>Display congratulations message.</li>
            <li>Stop the player from being able to enter more guesses (this would mess the game up).</li>
            <li>Display control allowing the player to restart the game.</li>
          </ol>
      </li>
      <li>If it is wrong and the player has turns left:</li>
      <li>
        <ol>
          <li>Tell the player they are wrong.</li>
          <li>Allow them to enter another guess.</li>
          <li>Increment the turn number by 1.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>If it is wrong and the player has no turns left:
        <ol>
          <li>Tell the player it is game over.</li>
          <li>Stop the player from being able to enter more guesses (this would mess the game up).</li>
          <li>Display control allowing the player to restart the game.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Once the game restarts, make sure the game logic and UI are completely reset, then go back to step 1.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Let's now move forward, looking at how we can turn these steps into code, building up the example, and exploring JavaScript features as we go.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Initial setup</h2>
    <p>To begin this tutorial, we'd like you to make a local copy of the number-guessing-game-start.html file (see it live here). Open it in both your text editor and your web browser. At the moment you'll see a simple heading, paragraph of instructions and form for entering a guess, but the form won't currently do anything.</p>

    <p>The place where we'll be adding all our code is inside the &lt;script&gt; element at the bottom of the HTML:</p>
    <div class="container">
      <code>
        <p>&lt;script&gt;</p>

        <p>// Your JavaScript goes here</p>

        <p>&lt;/script&gt;</p>
      </code>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <h2>Adding variables to store our data</h2>
    <p>Let's get started. First of all, add the following lines inside your &lt;script&gt; element:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>var randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;</li>

      <li>var guesses = document.querySelector('.guesses');</li>
      <li>var lastResult = document.querySelector('.lastResult');</li>
      <li>var lowOrHi = document.querySelector('.lowOrHi');</li>

      <li>var guessSubmit = document.querySelector('.guessSubmit');</li>
      <li>var guessField = document.querySelector('.guessField');</li>

      <li>var guessCount = 1;</li>
      <li>var resetButton;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This section of the code sets up the variables we need to store the data our program will use. Variables are basically containers for values (such as numbers, or strings of text). You create a variable with the keyword var followed by a name for your variable. You can then assign a value to your variable with an equals sign (=) followed by the value you want to give it.</p>
    <p>In our example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The first variable — randomNumber — is assigned a random number between 1 and 100, calculated using a mathematical algorithm.</li>
      <li>The next three variables are each made to store a reference to the results paragraphs in our HTML, and are used to insert values into the paragraphs later on in the code:</li>
        <ol>
          <li><code>&lt;p class="guesses"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></li>
          <li><code>&lt;p class="lastResult"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></li>
          <li><code>&lt;p class="lowOrHi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></li>
        </ol>
      <li>The next two variables store references to the form text input and submit button and are used to control submitting the guess later on.
        <ol>
          <li><code>&lt;label for="guessField">Enter a guess: &lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type="text" id="guessField" class="guessField"&gt;</code></li>
          <li><code>&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit guess" class="guessSubmit"&gt;</code></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Our final two variables store a guess count of 1 (used to keep track of how many guesses the player has had), and a reference to a reset button that doesn't exist yet (but will later).</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>Next, add the following below your previous JavaScript:</p>

    <ol>
      <code><li>function checkGuess() {</li>
      <li>alert('I am a placeholder');</li>
      <li>}</li></code>
    </ol>

    <p>Functions are reusable blocks of code that you can write once and run again and again, saving the need to keep repeating code all the time. This is really useful. There are a number of ways to define functions, but for now we'll concentrate on one simple type. Here we have defined a function by using the keyword function, followed by a name, with parentheses put after it. After that we put two curly braces ({ }). Inside the curly braces goes all the code that we want to run whenever we call the function.</p>

    <p>When we want to run the code, we type the name of the function followed by the parentheses.</p>

    <p>Let's try that now. Save your code and refresh the page in your browser. Then go into the developer tools JavaScript console, and enter the following line:</p>
    <code><p>checkGuess();</p></code>

    <p>After pressing <button class="small">Return</button> / <button class="small">Enter</button>, you should see an alert come up that says "I am a placeholder"; we have defined a function in our code that creates an alert whenever we call it.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Operators</h2>
    <p>JavaScript operators allow us to perform tests, do maths, join strings together, and other such things.</p>

    <p>If you haven't already done so, save your code, refresh the page in your browser, and open the developer tools JavaScript console. Then we can try typing in the examples shown below — type in each one from the "Example" columns exactly as shown, pressing <button class="small">Return</button> / <button class="small">Enter</button> after each one, and see what results they return. If you don't have easy access to the browser developer tools, you can always use the simple built in console seen below:</p>
    <p>First let's look at arithmetic operators, for example:</p>
    <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
      <thead>
        <tr class="thead-dark">
          <th>Operator</th>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th><mark>+</mark></th>
          <td>Addition</td>
          <td><mark>6 + 9</mark></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th><mark>-</mark></th>
          <td>Subtraction</td>
          <td><mark>20 - 15</mark></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th><mark>*</mark></th>
          <td>Multiplication</td>
          <td><mark>3 * 7</mark></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th><mark>/</mark></th>
          <td>Division</td>
          <td><mark>10 / 5</mark></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>You can also use the <mark>+</mark> operator to join text strings together (in programming, this is called concatenation). Try entering the following lines, one at a time:</p>
    <ol>
      <code>
        <li>var name = 'Bingo';</li>
        <li>name;</li>
        <li>var hello = ' says hello!';</li>
        <li>hello;</li>
        <li>var greeting = name + hello;</li>
        <li>greeting;</li>
      </code>
    </ol>
    <p class="mb-0">There are also some shortcut operators available, called augmented assignment operators. For example, if you want to simply add a new text string to an existing one and return the result, you could do this:</p>
    <li>name += ' says hello!';</li>
    This is equivalent to
    <li>name = name + ' says hello!';</li>
    <p>When we are running true/false tests (for example inside conditionals — see below) we use comparison operators. For example:</p>
    <table class="table table-bordered">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th role="col">Operator</th>
          <th role="col">Name</th>
          <th role="col">Example</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th role="row"><mark>===</mark></th>
          <td>Strict equality (is it exactly the same?)</td>
          <td><mark>5 === 2 + 4</mark></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th role="row"><mark>!==</mark></th>
          <td>Non-equality (is it not the same?)</td>
          <td><mark>'Chris' !== 'Ch' + 'ris'</mark></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th role="row"><mark><</mark></th>
          <td>Less than</td>
          <td><mark>10 < 6</mark></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th role="row"><mark>></mark></th>
          <td>Greater than</td>
          <td><mark>10 > 20</mark></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <hr>

    <h2>Conditionals</h2>
    <p>Returning to our <em><mark>checkGuess()</mark></em> function, I think it's safe to say that we don't want it to just spit out a placeholder message. We want it to check whether a player's guess is correct or not, and respond appropriately.</p>

    <p>At this point, replace your current <em><mark>checkGuess()</mark></em> function with this version instead:</p>
    <code>
      <ol>
        <li>function checkGuess() {</li>
        <li>var userGuess = Number(guessField.value);</li>
        <li>if (guessCount === 1) {</li>
        <li>  guesses.textContent = 'Previous guesses: ';</li>
        <li>}</li>
        <li>guesses.textContent += userGuess + ' ';</li>
        <li>if (userGuess === randomNumber) {</li>
        <li>lastResult.textContent = 'Congratulations! You got it right!';</li>
        <li>lastResult.style.backgroundColor = 'green';</li>
        <li>lowOrHi.textContent = '';</li>
        <li>setGameOver();</li>
        <li>} else if (guessCount === 10) {</li>
        <li>lastResult.textContent = '!!!GAME OVER!!!';</li>
        <li>setGameOver();</li>
        <li>} else {</li>
        <li>lastResult.textContent = 'Wrong!';</li>
        <li>lastResult.style.backgroundColor = 'red';</li>
        <li>if(userGuess < randomNumber) {</li>
        <li>lowOrHi.textContent = 'Last guess was too low!';</li>
        <li>} else if(userGuess > randomNumber) {</li>
        <li>lowOrHi.textContent = 'Last guess was too high!';</li>
        <li>}</li>
        <li>}</li>
        <li>guessCount++;</li>
        <li>guessField.value = '';</li>
        <li>guessField.focus();</li>
        <li>}</li>
      </ol>
    </code>

    <p>This is a lot of code — phew! Let's go through each section and explain what it does.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The first line (line 2 above) declares a variable called userGuess and sets its value to the current value entered inside the text field. We also run this value through the built-in Number() method, just to make sure the value is definitely a number.</li>
      <li>Next, we encounter our first conditional code block (lines 3–5 above). A conditional code block allows you to run code selectively, depending on whether a certain condition is true or not. It looks a bit like a function, but it isn't. The simplest form of conditional block starts with the keyword if, then some parentheses, then some curly braces. Inside the parentheses we include a test. If the test returns true, we run the code inside the curly braces. If not, we don't, and move on to the next bit of code. In this case the test is testing whether the guessCount variable is equal to 1 (i.e. whether this is the player's first go or not):
        <ol>
          <li><code>guessCount === 1</code></li>
        </ol>
      If it is, we make the guesses paragraph's text content equal to "Previous guesses: ". If not, we don't.
      </li>
      <li>Line 6 appends the current userGuess value onto the end of the guesses paragraph, plus a blank space so there will be a space between each guess shown.</li>
      <li>The next block (lines 8–24 above) does a few checks:
        <ul>
          <li>The first if(){ } checks whether the user's guess is equal to the randomNumber set at the top of our JavaScript. If it is, the player has guessed correctly and the game is won, so we show the player a congratulations message with a nice green color, clear the contents of the Low/High guess information box, and run a function called setGameOver(), which we'll discuss later.</li>
          <li>Now we've chained another test onto the end of the last one using an else if(){ } structure. This one checks whether this turn is the user's last turn. If it is, the program does the same thing as in the previous block, except with a game over message instead of a congratulations message.</li>
          <li>The final block chained onto the end of this code (the else { }) contains code that is only run if neither of the other two tests returns true (i.e. the player didn't guess right, but they have more guesses left). In this case we tell them they are wrong, then we perform another conditional test to check whether the guess was higher or lower than the answer, displaying a further message as appropriate to tell them higher or lower.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The last three lines in the function (lines 26–28 above) get us ready for the next guess to be submitted. We add 1 to the guessCount variable so the player uses up their turn (++ is an incrementation operation — increment by 1), and empty the value out of the form text field and focus it again, ready for the next guess to be entered.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Events</h2>
    <p>At this point we have a nicely implemented <em><mark>checkGuess()</mark></em> function, but it won't do anything because we haven't called it yet. Ideally we want to call it when the "Submit guess" button is pressed, and to do this we need to use an event. Events are things that happen in the browser — a button being clicked, a page loading, a video playing, etc. — in response to which we can run blocks of code. The constructs that listen out for the event happening are called event listeners, and the blocks of code that run in response to the event firing are called event handlers.</p>

    <p class="mb-0">Add the following line below your <em><mark>checkGuess()</mark></em> function:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>guessSubmit.addEventListener('click', checkGuess);</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here we are adding an event listener to the guessSubmit button. This is a method that takes two input values (called arguments) — the type of event we are listening out for (in this case click) as a string, and the code we want to run when the event occurs (in this case the checkGuess() function). Note that we don't need to specify the parentheses when writing it inside addEventListener()).</p>
    <p>Try saving and refreshing your code now, and your example should work — to a point. The only problem now is that if you guess the correct answer or run out of guesses, the game will break because we've not yet defined the setGameOver() function that is supposed to be run once the game is over. Let's add our missing code now and complete the example functionality.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Finishing the game functionality</h2>
    <p>Let's add that setGameOver() function to the bottom of our code and then walk through it. Add this now, below the rest of your JavaScript:</p>
    <ol>
      <code>
        <li>function setGameOver() {</li>
        <li>guessField.disabled = true;</li>
        <li>guessSubmit.disabled = true;</li>
        <li>resetButton = document.createElement('button');</li>
        <li>resetButton.textContent = 'Start new game';</li>
        <li>document.body.appendChild(resetButton);</li>
        <li>resetButton.addEventListener('click', resetGame);</li>
        <li>}</li>
      </code>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>The first two lines disable the form text input and button by setting their disabled properties to true. This is necessary, because if we didn't, the user could submit more guesses after the game is over, which would mess things up.</li>
      <li>The next three lines generate a new &lt;button&gt; element, set its text label to "Start new game", and add it to the bottom of our existing HTML.</li>
      <li>The final line sets an event listener on our new button so that when it is clicked, a function called resetGame() is run.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now we need to define this function too! Add the following code, again to the bottom of your JavaScript:</p>
    <ol>
      <code>
        <li>function resetGame() {</li>
        <li>guessCount = 1;</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>var resetParas = document.querySelectorAll('.resultParas p');</li>
        <li>for (var i = 0 ; i < resetParas.length ; i++) {</li>
        <li>resetParas[i].textContent = '';</li>
        <li>}</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>resetButton.parentNode.removeChild(resetButton);</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>guessField.disabled = false;</li>
        <li>guessSubmit.disabled = false;</li>
        <li>guessField.value = '';</li>
        <li>guessField.focus();</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>lastResult.style.backgroundColor = 'white';</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;</li>
        <li>}</li>
      </code> 
    </ol>

    <p>This rather long block of code completely resets everything to how it was at the start of the game, so the player can have another go. It:</p>
        <ul> 
          <li>Puts the guessCount back down to 1.</li>
          <li>Clears all the information paragraphs.</li>
          <li>Removes the reset button from our code.</li>
          <li>Enables the form elements, and empties and focuses the text field, ready for a new guess to be entered.</li>
          <li>Removes the background color from the lastResult paragraph.</li>
          <li>Generates a new random number so that you are not just guessing the same number again!</li>
        </ul>
      <p><strong>At this point you should have a fully working (simple) game — congratulations!</strong></p>
      <p>All we have left to do now in this article is talk about a few other important code features that you've already seen, although you may have not realized it.</p>
