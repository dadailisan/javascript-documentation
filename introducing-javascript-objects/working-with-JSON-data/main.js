//NOTES
// JSON is purely a data format â€” it contains only properties, no methods.
// JSON requires double quotes to be used around strings and property names. Single quotes are not valid.
// Even a single misplaced comma or colon can cause a JSON file to go wrong, and not work. You should be careful to validate any data you are attempting to use (although computer-generated JSON is less likely to include errors, as long as the generator program is working correctly). You can validate JSON using an application like JSONLint.
// JSON can actually take the form of any data type that is valid for inclusion inside JSON, not just arrays or objects. So for example, a single string or number would be a valid JSON object.
// Unlike in JavaScript code in which object properties may be unquoted, in JSON, only quoted strings may be used as properties.
